# Spotify Recommendations

## Description

This project is an analysis of my Spotify music tastes. The data set I will be working with is from a playlist of 1000 songs I like and 1000 songs I dislike. By using the Spotify API (and [SpotiPy](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)), I will be analyzing the [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/) of the tracks.
